### Hi there üëã

# About me 
- üíª Working at Software Developer.
- üë®‚Äçüéì Software Engineer from University of B√≠o-B√≠o.
- üå± I am a developer focused on code quality and its reusability. I adapt easily to changes and I am always looking for challenges that help me learn new technologies and creative ways to solve problems
Teaching and learning are my passions and I consider myself a very approachable person for conversation and asking for help, contributing to a respectful and collaborative work environment.
